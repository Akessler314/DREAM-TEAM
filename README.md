## Usage

### Account
You'll first need to make an account and be signed in before you can start building your monsters. You'll only need a username and password, so use the Sign Up/Sign In buttons at the top to sign up!

### Create
Once you're signed in, click on Create a Pokemon to begin your masterpiece. On the creation screen, you'll first need to give your monster a name. You can then use the pencil and eraser tools on the grid to begin drawing your creation. Next, choose your monster's types - monsters can have one or two types, which determines which attacks they're weak against and which ones they deal more damage with. Finally, give your monster some stats and choose which moves they should have. Click Save and Create Pokemon to finalize your monster.

### Battle
To battle monsters, you'll need to pick two from the homepage. To view available monsters, click on View All Pokemon. You'll see Battle buttons next to each monster, click on this button under two monsters to begin battling them.

On the battle screen, use the arrow keys and enter to pick between the menu options. You can use the Info option to view more information about a move, and use the Attack option to actually use that move. You'll find some moves are more effective against your opponent than others - you'll want to experiment to find which moves are strongest!
